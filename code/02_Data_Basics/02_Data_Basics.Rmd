## Welcome

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use R to inspect the contents of a data frame or tibble. Data frames and tibbles are R's structures for storing tabular data; if you inherit a tabular dataset in R, it will almost certainly come as one of these structures.

Here, you will learn how to do three things with data frames and tibbles:

1.  Look at the contents of a data frame or tibble
2.  Open a help page that describes a data frame or tibble
3.  Identify the variables and their types in a tibble

You will also meet the `palmerpenguins` and `nycflights` datasets. These datasets appear frequently in R examples.

The readings in this tutorial follow [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), sections 3.2 and 5.1.

## Data frames

### What is a data frame?

A **data frame** is a rectangular collection of values, usually organized so that variables appear in the columns and observations appear in rows.

Here is an example: the `penguins` data frame contains observations collected and published by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) from [Palmer Station](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), a long-term environmental research site in Antarctica. The data frame contains 344 rows and 8 columns. Each row represents a penguin, and each column represents a variable that describes the penguin. Each penguin is one of three different species.

```{r penguins-setup}
data(package = 'palmerpenguins')
```

```{r penguins, exercise = TRUE}
penguins
```

**Hint:** Type `penguins` and then click the Run Code button.

### A note about palmerpenguins

The code above worked because I've already loaded the `palmerpenguins` package for you in this tutorial: `penguins` comes in the palmerpenguins package. If you would like to look at `penguins` on your own computer, you will need to first load palmerpenguins. You can do that in two steps:

1.  Run `install.packages('palmerpenguins')` to install palmerpenguins if you do not yet have it.
2.  Load the package with the `library(palmerpenguins)` command.
3.  Run the command `data(package = 'palmerpenguins')` to load the `penguins` data frame into your R session.

After that, you will be able to access any dataset contained in the palmerpenguins package---until you close R.

### One thing to notice

Did you notice how much information was inside `penguins`? Me too. Sometimes the contents of a data frame are hard to interpret. Let's get some help with this...

## Help pages

### How to open a help page

You can learn more about `penguins` by opening its help page. The help page will explain where the `palmerpenguins` dataset comes from and what each variable in the `penguins` data frame describes. To open the help page, type `?penguins` in the code chunk below and then click "Run Code".

```{r help, exercise = TRUE}

```

::: {#help-hint}
**Hint:** Type `?penguins` and then click the Run Code button.

### ? syntax

You can open a help page for any object that comes with R or with an R package. To open the help page, type a `?` before the object's name and then run the command, as you did with `?penguins`. This technique works for functions, packages, and more. If you want to specify getting help for a function or dataset in a particular package, you can use the `::` operator. For example, `?dplyr::filter` will open the help page for the `filter()` function in the `dplyr` package.

Notice that objects created by you or your colleagues will not have a help page (unless you make one).

### Exercises

Use the code chunk below to answer the following questions.

```{r exercises1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r quiz1, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz",
  question("What does the `bill_depth_mm` variable of `penguins` describe?  Read the help for `?penguins` to find out.",
           answer("The depth below the surface that the penguin dives to catch fish"),
           answer("The species of penguin"),
           answer("The distance across the bill from the chin to the top of the bill", correct = TRUE),
           allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("How many rows are in the data frame named `penguins`?",
           answer("34"),
           answer("300"),
           answer("344", correct = TRUE),
           answer("3344"),
           incorrect = "Incorrect.\nHint: R numbers the rows of a data frame when it displays the contents of a data frame. As a result, you can spot the number of rows in `penguins` by examining `penguins` in the code block above.",
           allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("How many columns are in the data frame named `cars`?",
           answer("1"),
           answer("2"),
           answer("4"),
           answer("8", correct = TRUE),
           incorrect = "Incorrect.\nHint: If you inspect the contents of `penguins` in the code block above, it should be pretty easy to find the number of columns.",
           allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Data types

### Type codes

```{r types, echo = FALSE}
penguins
```

Did you notice that a row of three (or four) letter abbreviations appears under the column names of `penguins`? These abbreviations describe the *type* of data that is stored in each column of `penguins`:

-   `int` stands for integers.

-   `dbl` stands for doubles, or real numbers.

-   `chr` stands for character vectors, or strings.

-   `dttm` stands for date-times (a date + a time).

There are three other common types of variables that aren't used in this dataset but are used in other datasets:

-   `lgl` stands for logical, vectors that contain only `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

-   `fctr` stands for factors, which R uses to represent categorical variables with fixed possible values.

-   `date` stands for dates.

This row of data types is unique to tibbles and is one of the ways that tibbles try to be more user-friendly than data frames.

### Test your knowledge

```{r quiz2, echo=FALSE}
question("Which types of variables does `penguins` contain? Check all that apply.",
         type = "multiple",
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         incorrect = "Not quite right. Look a little closer at `penguins`.",
         answer("integers", correct = TRUE),
         answer("doubles", correct = TRUE),
         answer("factors", correct = TRUE),
         answer("characters", correct = TRUE),
         correct = "Great Job!"
)
```

### Congratulations
